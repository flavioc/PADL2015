Linear logic programs are challenging to implement efficiently because facts are
asserted and retracted frequently.  Implementation is made more difficult with
the introduction of useful features such as rule priorities, which are used to
specify the order of rule inference, and comprehensions or aggregates, which are
mechanisms that make data iteration and gathering more intuitive.  In this
paper, we describe a compilation scheme for transforming linear logic programs
enhanced with those features into efficient C++ code. Our experimental results
show that compiled logic programs are less than one order of magnitude slower
than hand-written C programs and much faster than interpreted languages such as
Python.
