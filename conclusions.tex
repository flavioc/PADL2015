In this paper, we have presented a compilation strategy for linear logic
programs with comprehensions, aggregates and rule priorities. Rule priorities
allow the programmer to assign priorities to rules so that higher priority rules
are applied before lower priority rules, while comprehensions and aggregates
allow the programmer to iterate through the database to derive new facts or
aggregate data. To the best of our knowledge, our compilation strategy is the
first to consider programs with these three important features and the first
efficient compilation strategy for forward-chaining linear logic programs.
We have also implemented and described important optimizations
such as fact updates and persistence checking and the importance of choosing the
right data structures for the needs of linear logic programs.
Finally, the experimental results show that LM is pretty competitive when
compared to hand-written programs written in C.
