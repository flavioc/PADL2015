This section presents experimental results for our compiled code.
We compare the execution speed of our code against a similar code in a virtual

This section presents initial results for our VM. First, we present a
comparison with similar programs written in other programming
languages in order to show evidence that our VM is viable. Then, we
present scalability results in order to show that LM programs can take
advantage of multicore architectures.

For our experimental setup, we used a machine with 32 (2x16) Core AMD
Opteron (tm) Processor 6274 $@$ 2.2 GHz with 32 GBytes of RAM memory
and running the Linux kernel 3.8.3-1.fc17.x86\_64.  We compiled our VM
using GCC 4.7.2 (g++) with the flags \texttt{-O3 -std=c+0x
  -march=x86-64}. We run all experiments 3 times and averaged the
execution time.
